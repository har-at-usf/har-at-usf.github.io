# Working with GPT-2-Simple

This walkthrough will explain how to get a working setup for Python's `gpt-2-simple` library. It includes  implementation of code, along with different adjustments that are required to get it set up on a Windows 10 environment. This guide is intended to be used for research purposes.

# Setup

- Download an install Python 3.7 from the Python project's webpage

- Add the Python/37 directory to your system path, like:

  `C:\Users\<My User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe`

  *Replace `<My User>` with your user's name.*

- Using the above path, install the following modules:

  `C:\Users\<My User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe -m tensorflow==1.14.0 gpt-2-simple`

  *Note: This targets the correct version of TensorFlow. gpt-2-simple breaks with later versions.*

# Input file

`gpt-2-simple` accepts a single file as input. It provides you with a sample, `shakespeare.txt`. Of course, you can use any text file as input.

In some cases, you'll need to sanitize the file prior to usage. Otherwise, the app will throw an error and break in the middle of text generation. One way to solve this is by converting the file from UTF-8 to ASCII, then using this sanitized file as the input. (The code solution provides a means to accomplish this in the static `Sanitizer.utf_to_ascii` method.)

# Running the program

Use the Python 3.7 binary to run the program. It will take a long time on most systems. You may want to run it at a time when you can leave the entire system alone for several hours: before going to bed, going to work, etc.

Recall that text will print to the console unless you redirect it to a file.

You can use a batch script to automate this process.

```bat
ECHO OFF
C:\Users\Eric-PC\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe gpt2test.py > gpt2test-output.txt
```

# Python code

The following code was taken from the `gpt-2-simple` Github page. It is distributed into different methods for convenience.

```python
"""
gpt2test - Perform tasks to generate text with the gpt-2-simple engine.
