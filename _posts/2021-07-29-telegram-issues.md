*This white paper is intended to spread awareness about Telegram's security and privacy issues. It was originally written as a policy brief to discourage organizations from relying on this for their communication. It has since been expanded to include technical details noted in peer-reviewed research.*

# Abstract 

Telegram, a platform lauded for its “security” and “privacy,” contains enough flaws in both domains to disqualify it as a secure or private platform. The default settings reveal the user’s private information, including their telephone number, and the default authentication method (SMS) leaves room for unauthorized access and a complete hijacking of a user’s account. For all their claims to an open-source frontend, the backend (servers) are completely closed-source. Despite their claims to “heavily encrypt” user data in their servers, the server-side encryption processes reveals the plaintext contents of default (“cloud”) conversations while each message is in transit. Further, the protocol (MTProto, version 2.0 at the time of writing) suffers from a wide variety of attacks, all of which are modeled based on Telegram’s own documentation. These protocolrelated issues undermine the security of “secret chats” (end-to-end encrypted). A user or administrator cannot remedy these issues because the server-side framework is completely closed-source. Ironically, although an organization’s administrator cannot view the contents of users’ cloud conversations, the servers convert that information to plaintext during transit. In lieu of Telegram, users and organizations should use a platform that implements secure protocols and enforces two-factor authentication. Security policies should reject a platform like Telegram for serious consideration for an organization’s communication. Recommendations are provided for two applications — Signal and Microsoft Teams — which meet business needs and security standards. Signal is recommended for individuals (for example, operating outside of an organization) who wish to communicate securely. Teams is acceptable for an organization where an administrator should be able to view the contents of conversations and implement organization-wide policies
